Describe the problem
I am trying to build tensorflow v2.6.0 on macOS Big Sur using the first version of M1 chip.

cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/meteorcloudy/tensorflow.git
cd tensorflow
modify .bazelversion to current version that I have installed using brew (4.2.1).
unset PYTHONPATH env
unset PYTHON_BIN_PATH env
./configure
bazel build --config=v2 --config=opt --cpu=darwin_arm64 //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
./bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
cd /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
pip install tensorflow-2.8.0-cp38-cp38-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl
ERROR: tensorflow-2.8.0-cp38-cp38-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.
Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before running into the problem
I got the error saying that the whl is not supported on this platform.
Is it something wrong when I use bazel?
I have tried to use
bazel build --config=v2 --config=opt --config=macos_arm64 //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
./bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
and I got the same error.

Please kindly let me know how to fix that.
Thanks
Kel
