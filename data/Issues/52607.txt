System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.5.0-rc3-213-ga4dfb8d1a71 2.5.0
Python version: 3.7
CUDA/cuDNN version: 11.2/8.1.0
GPU model and memory: 10x GTX 1080ti
Describe the current behavior
When using a strategy at the end of the program I got an AttributeError exception.

Exception ignored in: <function Pool.__del__ at 0x7f06a661ac10> 
Traceback (most recent call last): 
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/multiprocessing/pool.py", line 268, in del 
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/multiprocessing/queues.py", line 362, in put 
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'dumps'
The program works as expected, but it shows always that exception.

Describe the expected behavior
The program should exit without this exception

Standalone code to reproduce the issue

import tensorflow as tf 
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
