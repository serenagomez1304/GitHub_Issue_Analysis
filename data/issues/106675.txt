What happened?
I found that when the container is deleted, the image is being pulled until the image is pulled.

What did you expect to happen?
When the pod is deleted, terminate the mirror pull request

How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?
Scheduling a new pod to node, the image is relatively large
Then delete this pod
As you can see in the kubelet log, the pull has not been terminated, and the pod has been deleted
