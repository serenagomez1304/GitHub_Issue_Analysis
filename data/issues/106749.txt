What happened?
If A/D controller has shut down and pod referencing a CSI migrated volume is deleted (as commented in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/volume/csi/csi_attacher.go#L417-L420), the detach may not be handled correctly. Specific handing of this situation in 129f153#diff-3e8f8a6e5eca57db8e84bcc6c896f0a3b10289fe55d8e999b4bdf1cfdc0de394L510 was removed. Audit and bring back correct handling of this situation.

What did you expect to happen?
If A/D controller has shut down and pod referencing a CSI migrated volume is deleted (as commented in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/volume/csi/csi_attacher.go#L417-L420), the detach should be handled correctly.

How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?
A/D controller needs to be shut down and pod referencing a CSI migrated volume is deleted during that window.

Anything else we need to know?
