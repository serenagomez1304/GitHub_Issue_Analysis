description:
What happened?
why kubelet /run interface using space to split the cmd?

params.cmd = strings.Split(request.QueryParameter("cmd"), " ")
which leads to

ls -> ok
ls -a -> ok
/bin/sh "ls" -> ok
/bin/sh "ls -a" -> failed
What did you expect to happen?
I want to use kubelet /run interface to run a command in container, and get the run result. The command contains many spaces.

How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?
send to kubelet /run interface

curl -k -H "Authorization: xxx" -d 'cmd=/bin/sh -c "ls -l"' https:/xxx:10250/run/{ns}/{pod}/{container name}
Anything else we need to know?
