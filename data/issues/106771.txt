I have wondered if we should add a kubelet option like --cluster-dns-service (as an alternative to --cluster-dns) which takes a service ns/name (e.g. "kube-system/kube-dns") and looks up the IP(s). That would avoid the need for a static DNS IP at all.

Kubelet could spawn a gorotine to poll it. Any pod that starts before the DNS Service is up would not get a nameserver or maybe we just don't start pods which need that value until resolves. E.g. hostNetwork pods could start.

This would obviate the need for a special static DNS IP (the .10 IP by convention).
