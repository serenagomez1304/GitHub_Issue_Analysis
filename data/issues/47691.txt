System information

TensorFlow version (you are using): tf-nightly-gpu v2.5.0-dev20201214
Are you willing to contribute it (Yes/No):
Describe the feature and the current behavior/state.
Tensorflow is incompatible with numpy v1.20+ (recently released). This version introduces new functions and changes behaviours.

Will this change the current api? How?
There seems to be an issue with the way tensorflow or numpy handles symbolic tensors

Who will benefit with this feature?
Anyone wishing to use the new features or packages where numpy is a dependency. Virtual environments can circumvent this, but sometimes having numpy v1.20 in the same environment as tf can be neecssary or preferable

Any Other info.
