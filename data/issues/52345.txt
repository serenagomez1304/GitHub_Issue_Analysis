description:
When I run a tensorflow model then I am getting the error - ImportError: libcudnn.so.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.

The missing files are present at the specified location. I have install cuda 11.4 and cuda 9.0.

Exporting the files from terminal or adding them on .bashrc file does not work.

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
