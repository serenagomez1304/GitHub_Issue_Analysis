I want to set the learning rate at 10^-3 with a decay every 10 epochs by a factor of 0.9. I am using the Adam optimizer in Tensorflow Keras. I have found this code in the official documentation:

initial_learning_rate = 0.1

lr_schedule = tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay(
    initial_learning_rate,
    decay_steps=100000,
    decay_rate=0.96,
    staircase=True
)
I do not know what is this decay_steps=100000. Actually, I want to decrease my learning rate after 10 epochs. How can I do it?
