I was testing the code from : https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/custom_training_walkthrough

After this line:

train_dataset = train_dataset.map(pack_features_vector)
features, labels = next(iter(train_dataset))

I got this error:

AttributeError: in user code:

File "<ipython-input-11-b2720b65aaf7>", line 3, in pack_features_vector  *
    features = tf.stack(list(features.values()), axis=1)
