OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: -
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.4.0-49-g85c8b2a817f 2.4.1
Python version: 3.8.5

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
script
You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"
Describe the current behavior
Splitting a Dataset and then reading the first item of the Validation Dataset loads indefinitely.

train_dataset = dataset.take(n_train_items)
val_dataset = dataset.skip(n_train_items)
Calling next(iter(train_dataset .take(1))) works calling next(iter(val_dataset .take(1))) loads indefinitely.

Describe the expected behavior
I want my Validation Dataset to just return Data as expected.

Stackoverflow Post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69634758/reading-validation-dataset-takes-indefinitely-long
The Problem is withing prep_image, when i just return the Filename without opening the Data everything works as expected:

def prep_image(filename, img_shape=(144,144), channels=3, dtype=tf.float32):
    return filename
#    image_string = tf.io.read_file(filename)
#    image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image_string, channels=channels)
#    image = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, dtype)
#    image = tf.image.resize(image, img_shape)
#    return image
If i just return the Output of tf.io.read_file the first item of the Validation-Dataset already loads indefinitely:

def prep_image(filename, img_shape=(144,144), channels=3, dtype=tf.float32):
    return tf.io.read_file(filename)
Edit:// Loading the First Train-Dataset Item Takes:
0:00:00.063014 HH:MM:SS:ms
and getting the first Validation item takes:
0:31:09.717694
