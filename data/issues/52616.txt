1. System information
Linux Ubuntu 20.04,
android API 25
tf-nightly keras=2.4.3
2. Code
CRNN model use rashape like this:

 x = layers.Reshape((4, 128))(x)
Convert code:

keras_model = models.load_model(model_path, custom_objects={ 'precision': precision, 'recall': recall, 'f_score': f_score})
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(keras_model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()
open(save_mdl_path, "wb").write(tflite_model)
3. (optional) Any other info / logs
The CRNN TFlite model (have rashape) can work on Android CPU, but set GPU will get erro: "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Internal error: Failed to apply delegate: Attempting to use a delegate that only supports static-sized tensors with a graph that has dynamic-sized tensors (tensor#40 is a dynamic-sized tensor)."

The tflite model can work on android GPU when delete the layers.rshape and GRU .

I need reshspe layer for 3D to 2D dim. how I can do this?

thanks advance
